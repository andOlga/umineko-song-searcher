This is the source code for the app located at https://andolga.github.io/umineko-song-searcher. See that website for the details on the app.

To run the app offline, just [download the code](https://github.com/andOlga/umineko-song-searcher/archive/refs/heads/master.zip), extract it, and point any web server at the folder (on any modern OS, you can do this by running `python -m http.server` in the folder). Do **not** open `index.html` directly, as you will be cors-blocked by your browser.
