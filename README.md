This is the source code for the app located at https://andolga.github.io/umineko-song-searcher. See that website for the details on the app.

To run the app offline, [download it](https://github.com/andOlga/umineko-song-searcher/archive/refs/heads/master.zip), point your web server software at the extracted files and connect to it.

Do not try to open `index.html` directly, it won't work. If you are unfamiliar with setting up a web server, you can use [SimpleWebServer](https://simplewebserver.org/) as a starting point.

You may also be interested in the [extraction scripts](../../tree/master/extraction).
