This folder contains a batch script to help you extract the Umineko soundtrack,
with filenames matching the names of the actual songs and sorted in order of in-game appearance, from your game installation.

The extraction script supports Umineko Project (v8.1b or later) and the Steam release of Umineko Chiru ("Answer Arcs"). While the Steam release of Rondo ("Question Arcs") will technically work, it's missing all the tracks from EP5 onwards, so you won't be able to obtain a complete soundtrack this way.

Despite the script supporting the Steam version, Umineko Project is the recommended source of music. It provides a more complete collection of tracks: several songs either cannot be extracted from the Steam version easily or are outright missing. The audio quality in Umineko Project is also noticeably higher. If you do not have access to Umineko Project, you will need to look up and download the following tracks yourself to complete your collection:

- system0 (uncensored version)
- Swee-Swee‚≠êSWEETS(^-^)!
- Witch of Occultics (Occultics no Majo)
- The Pithos in the Fog (Kiri no Pithos)
- Igreja of Echoing Vows (Senkyou no Igreja)
- Innana's Dream (Innana no Mita Yume)

To use the script, download `extract.bat`, place it in your game folder (where the .exe is) and double-click it to run.
It will extract the soundtrack files and open the folder with them.
