This folder contains a set of batch scripts to help you extract the Umineko soundtrack,
with filenames matching the names of the actual songs, from your game installation.

If you are using Umineko Project, download `umineko-project.bat`. You have to be on `v8.1b` or later.

If you are using the Steam/GOG/Mangagamer release, download `steam.bat`. This one is meant to be used with the Answer Arcs release, as that contains all music tracks from both Question and Answer arcs. Running it on Question Arcs will work fine, but you'll only be able to get the music from episodes 1-4 that way.

Place either script in your game folder (where the .exe is) and double-click it to run.
It will extract the soundtrack files and open the folder with them.
