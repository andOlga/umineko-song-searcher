  Type some text from <nobr>Umineko no Naku Koro ni</nobr> to figure out the song that plays at this moment. Notes:
  <ul>
    <li>This works only with the official translation that is published by Mangagamer, with or without the <nobr>07th-Mod</nobr> patch.
      This won't work if you're using the old <nobr>Witch Hunt</nobr> translation patch or UmiTweak due to translation differences.
      <nobr>Umineko Project</nobr> and the PS4/Switch release are also unsupported, though those have built-in track name display while a song plays so you won't need this.
    </li>
    <li>Fragments of text that are too long may not work due to formatting commands appearing in the middle.</li>
    <li>Fragments of text that are too short may end up with the wrong song result because they are not unique.</li>
    <li>If the song that is found doesn't seem correct, try searching for a longer Fragment of text or just scroll forward/backward a bit in the game and try a different Fragment.</li>
    <li>
      Generally, a Fragment of text corresponding to a single voice clip in <nobr>07th-Mod</nobr> should work. It may or may not be a complete sentence.
    </li>
    <li>
      Sequences of about 5 words, give or take, tend to work correctly.
    </li>

    </li>
    <li>If you would like to play a much better version of Umineko, with built-in track name display, extra content, animations and major UI improvements, buy the Switch version of the game and <a href="https://github.com/andOlga/umineko-catbox-english">patch it</a> into English.</li>
