Type some text from Umineko no Naku Koro ni to figure out the song that plays at this moment. Notes:
<ul>
  <li>This works only with the official translation that is published by MangaGamer, and with 07th Mod.
    This won't work if you're reading the old Witch Hunt translation, UmiTweak, or Umineko Project.</li>
  <li>Pieces of text that are too long may not work (due to formatting commands appearing in the middle).
    Generally, a piece of text corresponding to a single voice clip should work, but it doesn't have to even be a complete sentence.
    Sequences of about 5 words tend to work correctly.</li>
  <li>Pieces of text that are too short may end up with the wrong song result because they are not unique.
    If the song that is found doesn't seem correct, try searching for a longer piece of text or just scroll forward/backward a bit and try a different one.
  </li>
</ul>
